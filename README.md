### ðŸ¤– **Used Github bots**

These are recommended bots that are prepared and configured for this template. If you install them your coding experience will probably be much better.
We deeply recommend at least installing the [issue label bot](https://github.com/marketplace/issue-label-bot) as this bot is the one that adds all the labels used in the issue templates.

1. The `issue_label_bot.yaml` file depends on the **[issue label bot](https://github.com/marketplace/issue-label-bot)**.
2. The `settings.yml` file depends on the **[settings label bot](https://probot.github.io/apps/settings/)**.
3. The `config.yml` file depends on the bot **[welcome bot](https://probot.github.io/apps/welcome/)** and **[todo bot](https://probot.github.io/apps/todo/)**
